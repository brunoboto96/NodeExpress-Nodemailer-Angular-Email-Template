# Node Express Server using Nodemailer! + Angular form

Hi! This is a simple backend server that sends emails from a form.


# Installation
This is how to setup the project.

# Node

    npm init

This will create a package.json file which will be used to track any dependencies we use. `npm init` will ask for a info, the name should be the same as the .js file. In this case `app.js`.

`npm install --save express cors body-parser nodemailer`

Installs the dependencies.

`node app.js`

Runs the server on port 3000 in this case.

# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
